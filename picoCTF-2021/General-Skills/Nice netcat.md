## Description
There is a nice program that you can talk to by using this command in a shell: 
$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 21135, but it doesn't speak English...

copy paste the netcat command and you will see we have a bunch of decimal numbers. As the hint says we need to convert it to ascii.
Use any online tool or python to convert it to ascii. Here i have used [this](https://www.prepostseo.com/tool/decimal-to-ascii).<br>
