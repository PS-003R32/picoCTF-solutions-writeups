## Description
Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition http://mercury.picoctf.net:34561/

With the help of the hints you will know that we have to change the HTTP request method in order to get the flag. You will notice that the name of the challenge itself 
is enough to solve this challenge as the http GET and HEAD are valid requests. Open burpsuite and click on http history and send the request with the GET parameter to the repeater.<br>

Now go to repeater and change the request to HEAD from GET. And here is our flag.<br>
