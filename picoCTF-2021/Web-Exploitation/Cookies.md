In this challenge we need to deal with cookies. On the page you will see we have to type in the name of a cookie. Right click on the page and navigate to `storage` then `cookies`. 
There you will notice we have a name parameter and a value parameter. <br>

If we try to manipulate the name parameter we dont really get anything. so manipulate the `value` parameter, double click > change value > enter > reload site.<br>

And now we will see some hints, we need to guess the correct cookie name to get the flag. try to cycle through 1 till you get the number which reveals the flag. Here it was 18.<br>
