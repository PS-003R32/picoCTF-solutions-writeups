## Description
I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. 
As a bonus, my pages load faster! Browse [here](http://titan.picoctf.net:60658/), and find the flag!

---
Launch your instance and click on the link. The page says the flag has been delivered. So it might be in the cookies or in the source code.
Right click on the page and navigate to view source code. You will see the code is in a single line and very possibly hard to find the flag.
if you use the find in page option and search for picoCTF{ you will get a bunch of matches. 
So insted we will use the curl command to get the contents of the web page.
```bash
curl -vv http://titan.picoctf.net:60658/ | grep picoCTF{.*}
```
this will match the string and also return the match containing all contents insede the braces.
And heres our flag.
