## Description
A type of transposition cipher is the rail fence cipher, which is described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_fence_cipher). Here is one such cipher encrypted using the rail fence with 4 rails. 
Can you decrypt it? Download the message [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/188/message.txt). Put the decoded message in the picoCTF flag format, picoCTF{decoded_message}.

You can visit the page to read about the cipher. I have used [this](https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/rail-fence-cipher) online tool to decode the message.

On this website you need to toggle the number of rails to decode, here 4 rails decoded the message.
