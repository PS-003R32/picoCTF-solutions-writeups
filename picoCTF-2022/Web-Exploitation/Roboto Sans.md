## Description
The flag is somewhere on this web application not necessarily on the website. Find it. Check [this](http://saturn.picoctf.net:54769/) out.

The title suggests us that the flag might be somewhere in a directory related to roboto sans, which is a font type. So you might go to the `css` file, 
but the flag is not present there. If you crawl through all the links the flag is not there either. 
So we will try navigating to the `robots.txt` file because it has allow lists. Type `/robots.txt` in the url. You will notice two lines containing, which
looks like `base64` encoding.

Copy the encoded text and use the command line utility for base64 to decode it.<br>
```bash
echo "ZmxhZzEudHh0;anMvbXlmaWanMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==" | base64 -d
```
You will notice it throws an error.

Now we only have this encoded text. Do the decoding in parts as theres a semicolon which might be throwing an error.
If you decode the second line, you will see it returns a path.

Navigate to the path by adding it to the original url, as below.
