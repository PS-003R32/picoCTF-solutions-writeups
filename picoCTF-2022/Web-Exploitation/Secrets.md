## Description
We have several pages hidden. Can you find the one with the flag? The website is running [here](http://saturn.picoctf.net:55257/).

---
Try crawling to each page to find any clues. Here go to the source page for contact.html. there you will notice we have a path called `secret/assets/`.
copy and paste this path to the original url. You will see the page is not there, remove assets from the path. And you will see this page which means a step closer.<br>

Now view the source page for this page. You will notice theres another path. `hidden/file.css`, navigate to the page, but you will find nothing.
Now add the path `/hidden/` to the url. Now you have a login page, you might try to login by providing random uid and passwd then go to the cookies section to mod any parameters.
But thats not going to work for this challenge. Now again view the source of the new login page. You will notice we have another path `superhidden/login.css`, again follow the drill.
add the superhidden path to the url. So the final path becomes, `/secret/hidden/superhidden/`. And now we have another page, which is our intended page. but its not visible, we might need to change
css properties to view. Or just press Ctrl+a.<br>
