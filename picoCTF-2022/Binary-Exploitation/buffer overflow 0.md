## Description
Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? 
The program is available [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/172/vuln). You can view source [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/172/vuln.c). 
Connect using: nc saturn.picoctf.net 53728 `launch instance`

In this buffer overflow challenge if you open the `vuln.c` file and analyze the code, If this handler is triggered, it prints the flag and exits.
`strcpy(buf2, input)` copies the entire input, if the input is more than 16 bytes, it will overflow buf2. A segmentation fault raises `SIGSEGV` , sigsegv_handler is called.
So use the followin to to test the source code after you wget the `vuln` (chmod +x vuln, before you try to execute ./vuln) lsb pie file.
```bash
python -c "print('A'*32)" | ./vuln
```
