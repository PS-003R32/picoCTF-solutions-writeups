In this challenge you need to know how to send requests to the server. As the title says where are the robots which directly hints us to find the `robots.txt` file.
robots.txt file basically tells web crawlers and bots which parts of the site they should or shouldn't access.
If you use burpsuite to crawl the link, it wont be able to find the path that has the flag. So, add `/robots.txt` in the existing url in your browssr.

You will se it has a path that is set not to navigate for crawlers. So we will obviously try to access the page on `/477ce.html`.
add this path to the original url and thats it you have the flag...;)
