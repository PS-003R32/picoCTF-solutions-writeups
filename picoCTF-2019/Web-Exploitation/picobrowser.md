In this challenge the server will only respond and return the flag if we are using `picobrowser`. Since theres no such browser, we will use curl to send http requests.
curl has a useragent field which we can set for any browser. So we will use the following command to send requests.
```bash
curl -A "picobrowser" https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/28921/flag > opt.txt
```
now cat out the contents of the output. You will see the flag is in the html code. So use the grep command to get the flag.
```bash
cat opt.txt | grep picoCTF{.*]
```
the `grep picoCTF{.*]` will return the flag by finding the string. `{.*}` will find anything inside the `{}` field.
