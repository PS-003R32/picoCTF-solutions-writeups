Description
I accidentally wrote the flag down. Good thing I deleted it! You download the challenge files here:
    challenge.zip: https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/77/challenge.zip

In this easy level challenge we have to perform some git commands.
Download the challenge.zip file and unzip the file.
Move to drop-in directory and you have a txt file which when cat ourt shows 'TOP SECRET'.
we will use git commands to solve this challenge. use '$git + TAB' to view all options for git.

How to solve:
$wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/77/challenge.zip
$unzip challenge.zip && cd drop-in
$git + tab (to view options)
$git log
$git show <commit ID of 'remove sensitive info'> (this will reveal the flag)
