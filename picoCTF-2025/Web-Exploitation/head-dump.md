## Description
Welcome to the challenge! In this challenge, you will explore a web application and find an endpoint that exposes a file containing a hidden flag. 
The application is a simple blog website where you can read articles about various topics, including an article about API Documentation. 
Your goal is to explore the application and find the endpoint that generates files holding the serverâ€™s memory, where a secret flag is hidden. 
The website is running [picoCTF News](http://verbal-sleep.picoctf.net:52213/).

After exploring the website you will find a very interesting tag `#API Documentation`,other tags will land the home page.
